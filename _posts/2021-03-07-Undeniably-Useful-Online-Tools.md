A lot of my PhD so far has been about building helpful tools (and techniques). Here are some online tools that I found very valuable in this process:

* Symbolic matrix  differentiation at <http://www.matrixcalculus.org/>.
* The famed matrix cookbook: <https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf>
* A huge list of useful inequalities: <http://www.lkozma.net/inequalities_cheat_sheet/>
* A better way to search arxiv: <http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/>
