			<font size="-1"><p> Hi! My name is Kaustubh Sridhar and I'm a first year PhD at <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu/">Electrical and Systems Enginnering</a>, University of Pennsylvania. I am passionate about research in Robotics with a particular interest in the safety, security and reliability of cyber-physical systems.  </p>
			<p> I am currently working with <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml">Prof. Insup Lee</a> & <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=91">Prof. Oleg Sokolysky</a> on buidling a universal template for checkpointing and attack resilient-control of cyber-physical systems </p>
			<p> I worked with <a href="http://sc.iitb.ac.in/~srikant/dokuwiki/doku.php">Prof. Srikant Sukumar</a> during my Bachelor's Thesis on Event Triggered Control of Quadrotors. We published a paper on this at the <a href="https://eurognc19.polimi.it/">5th CEAS Conference on Guidance, Navigation and Control, 2019</a></p>
			<p> I spent the summer of 2018 at <a href="https://ece.duke.edu">Duke University (Electrical and Computer Engineering)</a> under the guidance of <a href="http://people.duke.edu/~mp275/">Prof. Miroslav Pajic</a> creating a self-driving car like platform on which Intrusion Detection Systems can be tested.</p>
			<p> In the summer of 2017, I worked on Bio-inspired Landing of Quadrotors using a Vision-INS Navigation System. This was done at the <a href="http://aero.iisc.ernet.in">Indian Institute of Science, Banglore</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=Va1aENIAAAAJ">Prof. Radhakant Padhi</a> and a <a href="https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896318302428">paper</a> on the same was published in the proceedings of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/ifac-papersonline/vol/51/issue/1">5th IFAC Conference on Advances in Control and Optimisation of Dynamic Systems, 2018</a></p>
			<p> I have also spent some time working on Autonomous Indoor Navigation for ground and aerial vehicles with <a href=""> Prof. Hemendra Arya</a> at IIT Bombay</p>
			
			<p> Details about the research mentioned above can be found <a href="https://kaustubhsridhar.github.io/research/">here</a> </p>
			
			<p> I also enjoy a good game of Tennis and Squash and avidly consume American Fiction and TV </p>
