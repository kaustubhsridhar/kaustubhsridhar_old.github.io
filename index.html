	<p>I'm a PhD candidate in <a href="https://www.ese.upenn.edu/">Electrical and Systems Enginnering</a> at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~lee/home/index.shtml">Insup Lee</a>, <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~weimerj/research.html">James Weimer</a> and <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=91">Oleg Sokolsky</a>.

	<p>I did a summer internship at <a href="https://www.argo.ai/">Argo AI</a>'s autonomous vehicle security and functional safety (FuSa) team in the summer of 2021. Previously, I graduated with honors from the <a href="https://www.iitb.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</a> and spent a summer as an intern at <a href="https://ece.duke.edu/">Duke University</a>.</p>

	<p><small>Improving adversarial robustness of neural networks remains a major challenge. Fundamentally, training a neural network via gradient descent is a parameter estimation problem. In adaptive control, maintaining persistency of excitation (PoE) is integral to ensuring convergence of parameter estimates in dynamical systems to their true values. We show that parameter estimation with gradient descent can be modeled as a sampling of an adaptive linear time-varying continuous system. Leveraging this model, and with inspiration from Model-Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), we prove a sufficient condition to constrain gradient descent updates to reference persistently excited trajectories converging to the true parameters. The sufficient condition is achieved when the learning rate is less than the inverse of the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of loss function. We provide an efficient technique for estimating the corresponding Lipschitz constant in practice using extreme value theory. Our experimental results in both standard and adversarial training illustrate that networks trained with the PoE-motivated learning rate schedule have similar clean accuracy but are significantly more robust to adversarial attacks than models trained using current state-of-the-art heuristics.

	<p><small>We propose a novel attack- and dataset-agnostic and real-time detector for digital / physical adversarial inputs to DNN-based perception systems. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed detector on ImageNet, a task that is computationally challenging for the majority of relevant defenses, and on physically attacked traffic signs that may be encountered in real-time autonomy applications.</small></p>

	<p>preprint (TBA) / code (TBA)</p>
	<p><small>We address the problem of responding after sensors (of a CPS) have been attacked with a novel real-time model-predictive control (MPC) based recovery algorithm. Our approach leverages reachability analysis to compute a time deadline for recovery. It dynamically accomodates varying deadlines / prediction horizons, and utilizes uncompromised sensor feedback to generate optimal recovery control sequences. More TBA.</small></p>

	<p><small>We tackle the problem of making complex resource-constrained	cyber-physical systems (CPS) resilient to sensor anomalies. We present a framework for checkpointing and roll-forward recovery of state-estimates in nonlinear, hierarchical CPS with anomalous sensor data. A simulated ground robot case-study demonstrates its scalability and improved performance over an Extended Kalman Filter.</small></p>
